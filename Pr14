Steps to Deploy an Android Application 
1. Prepare App (use Program 1 Hello world for this program) 
• Optimize performance and test thoroughly. 
• Ensure compatibility with various devices. 

activity_main.xml 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf8"?> 
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" 
xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/resauto" 
xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools" 
android:layout_width="match_parent" 
android:layout_height="match_parent" 
tools:context=".MainActivity"> 
<TextView 
android:layout_width="wrap_content" 
android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
android:text="Hello World!" 
app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent" 
app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent" 
app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent" 
app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" android:textSize="30sp"/> 
</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout> 

MainActivity.java 
package com.bca.helloworld; 
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity; 
import android.os.Bundle; 
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity 
{ 
} 
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) 
{ 
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); 
setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); 
}


2. Generate Signed APK (Android Package Kit): 
• In Android Studio, navigate to Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK. 
• Follow the prompts to create a new keystore or use an existing one. A keystore is a binary 
file that contains a set of private keys. 
• Configure the build type (release) and signing configuration.
• Generate the signed APK file. 
3. Test Your Signed APK: 
• Before distributing your app, test the signed APK to ensure that the signing process didn't 
introduce any issues. 
• Install the APK on various devices and perform thorough testing. 
• Release on Google Play Console: 
• Sign in to the Google Play Console (https://play.google.com/apps/publish). 
• Create a new app entry if this is your first release or select an existing app. 
• Complete all the required information for the app listing, including the title, description, 
screenshots, and categorization. 
• Upload your signed APK file. 
• Set pricing and distribution options. 
• Optimize your store listing for search and conversion. 
• Once everything is set, click the "Publish" button to release your app to the Google Play 
Store. 
5. Other Distribution Channels (Optional): 
• Besides Google Play, you can distribute your app through other channels such as 
Amazon Appstore, Samsung Galaxy Store, or thirdparty app marketplaces. 
• Each distribution channel may have its own requirements and submission process, so be 
sure to follow their guidelines. 
6. Monitor and Update: 
• Keep an eye on user feedback and app performance metrics through the Google Play 
Console. 
• Regularly update your app to fix bugs, add new features, and improve user experience based 
on feedback.
